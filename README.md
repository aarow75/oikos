This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Note: for this sample project no unit tests have been written for the services and components, so code coverage is abysmal.
